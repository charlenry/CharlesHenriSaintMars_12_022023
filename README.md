# Project 12 - SportSee Analytics Dashboard

This Frontend project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is an analytics dashboard with a separately frontend part and a backend part. The application is developed with Node.js version 16.14.2 and React version 18.2.0.

1. To test this application, you need fist to clone the backend application from [https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard). So you can run `yarn start` on a terminal and it will start on the `port 3000`.

2. Afterwards, clone this projet and run `yarn start` on an other terminal. The application will say `Something is already running on port 3000. Would you like to run the app on another port instead? Â» (Y/n)`. Just type `y` and it will open your browser at the address [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

At this moment, you can use the following addresses :
* [http://localhost:3001/user/12](http://localhost:3001/user/12) - 12 is the user ID. You can also use the number 18 for the user ID.
* [http://localhost:3001/user/12/activity](http://localhost:3001/user/12/activity)
* [http://localhost:3001/user/12/average-sessions](http://localhost:3001/user/12/average-sessions)
* [http://localhost:3001/user/12/performance](http://localhost:3001/user/12/performance)

The frontend part is still in development.
