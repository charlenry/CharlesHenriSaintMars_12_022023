# Project 12 - SportSee Analytics Dashboard

This Frontend project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is an analytics dashboard with a separately frontend part and a backend part. The application is developed with Node.js version 16.14.2 and React version 18.2.0.

1. To test this web application, you need fist to clone the backend application from [https://github.com/charlenry/P12-backend-api](https://github.com/charlenry/P12-backend-api). Then go to the folder where the `package.json` file is located and run in a terminal the command `yarn add` to install all dependencies from the package.json file. After that, you can run the command `yarn start` on a terminal and it will start on the `port 3000`.

2. Afterwards, clone this projet (not in the folder of the previous cloned project). Then go to the folder where the package.json file is located and run in an other terminal the command `yarn install`. When finished, run the command `yarn start`. The application will say `Something is already running on port 3000. Would you like to run the app on another port instead? Â» (Y/n)`. Just type `y` and it will open your browser at the address [http://localhost:3001/CharlesHenriSaintMars_12_022023/build](http://localhost:3001/CharlesHenriSaintMars_12_022023/build).

3. If the API server (the backend) is not available, this web application can still work with embedded local data. Just run the command `yarn start`. Then it will open your browser at the address [http://localhost:3000/CharlesHenriSaintMars_12_022023/build](http://localhost:3000/CharlesHenriSaintMars_12_022023/build).
